# Creating a Workflow{#creating-a-workflow}

Adobe Campaign includes a workflow module that empowers you to orchestrate the full range of processes and tasks across the different modules of the application server. This comprehensive graphical environment lets you design processes including segmentation, campaign execution, file processing, human participation, etc. The workflow engine executes and tracks these processes.

Workflows occur within various contexts and stages of the campaign management process.

Adobe Campaign uses workflows to:

* Carry out targeting campaigns. For more on this, refer to [Implementation steps](https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/AC/en/WKF__General_operation_Building_a_workflow.html#Implementation_steps_).
* Build campaigns: for each campaign, the **Workflow** tab lets you build the target and create the deliveries. For more on this, refer to [Campaign workflows](https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/AC/en/WKF__General_operation_Building_a_workflow.html#Campaign_workflows).
* Performing Adobe Campaign technical processes: cleanup, collecting tracking information or provisional calculations. For more on this, refer to [Technical workflows](https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/AC/en/WKF__General_operation_Building_a_workflow.html#Technical_workflows).
