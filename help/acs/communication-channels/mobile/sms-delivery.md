# Creating a SMS delivery{#creating-a-sms-delivery}

This video explains how to create a SMS delivery in Adobe Campaign Standard. You can also configure the sending of SMS in a workflow using the SMS delivery activity.

The SMS delivery activity is generally used to automate sending of SMS. The configuration of this activity is the same as the configuration of the one time delivery described in the video.
