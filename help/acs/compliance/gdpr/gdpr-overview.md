# How to create General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Requests with the Adobe Campaign Standard User Interface

Adobe Campaign offers Data Controllers three possibilities for performing GDPR access requests:
* Via the Privacy Core Service integration, 
* The Adobe Campaign interface
* The API 

The steps to create GDPR requests via the Adobe Campaign Standard interface are as follows:

**1. Create a Namespace**
Before creating GDPR requests, you need to define the namespace you will use. The namespace is the key that will be used to identify the Data Subject in the Adobe Campaign database.
