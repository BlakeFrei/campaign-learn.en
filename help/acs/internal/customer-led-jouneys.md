# Customer led journeys{#customer-led-journeys}

The feature determines in multistep flows called journeys the next best actions specific to the consumer, based on their profile and behaviors. This comprises both the optimal timing, as well as the type action, such as sending the consumer an update via push notification or the notification of a third party system. These decisions are made based on rules and Sensei scores.

Journeys leverages data stored on the Experience Platform, data stored in any third party service that can be queried through an API call, and contextual information shared through the payload of the event triggering the journeys.

## Getting Started {#getting-started}

## How to troubleshoot {#how-to-troubleshoot}

There are several tools available to troubleshoot your journeys

* Check that events are properly sent

* Track if people enter the journey
* Track how people navigate through the journey
* Track that messages are sent successfully
* Test journeys before publication
