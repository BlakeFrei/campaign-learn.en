# Privacy Requests with the Adobe Campaign Standard User Interface

Adobe Campaign offers Data Controllers three methods for performing Privacy access and delete requests of PII data in compliance with privacy acts such as GDPR and CCPA. :

* **Via the Privacy Core Service integration(Adobe recommended method:** Privacy requests pushed from the Privacy Core Service to all Experience Cloud solutions are automatically handled by Campaign via a dedicated workflow. Refer to the [Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service](https://adobe.io/apis/cloudplatform/gdpr.html) to learn how to create Privacy requests from the Privacy Core Service.
  
* **Via the API:** Adobe Campaign provides an API that allows the automatic process of Privacy requests using REST.
  
* **Via the Adobe Campaign interface:** for each Privacy request, the Data Controller creates a new privacy request in Adobe Campaign
