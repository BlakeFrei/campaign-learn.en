# Leveraging Experience Platform Audiences - Overview

This tutorial explains how to leverage centralized and consolidated profile data from the Adobe Experience Platform for marketing campaigns in Adobe Campaign Standard.

The Audiences module within Adobe Campaign Standard  allows you to create segments using data from the [Adobe Experience Platform - Data Services](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/services.html) that lives in the [Real-Time Customer Profile](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/platform-learn/tutorials/profiles/understanding-the-real-time-customer-profile.html).
