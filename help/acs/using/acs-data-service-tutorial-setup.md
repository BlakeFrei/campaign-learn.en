# Data Service{#data-service}

Data Service enables Adobe Campaign Standard users to map custom resources and experience events residing in ACS to XDM schema and transmit data from ACS to Data platform. It transmits data natively collected in Campaign (touchpoints/Landing Pages, Subscription/unsubscription etc.) to Platform . Both Batch as well as Streaming Data Transfer are covered. The service is Uni-Directional, from Campaign to Platform only.
