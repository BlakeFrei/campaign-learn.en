# Introduction to the Adobe Dreamweaver Integration{#introduction-to-the-adobe-dreamweaver-integration}

**Key Functionality of the the Dreamweaver integration with Adobe Campaign Standard:**

* **Bidirectional syncing** - this means that whenever an edit is made in one product, it is updated in real time in the other. Say, for instance, you want to change the color of text in Dw. As soon as you make that edit, the color of the text is live in AC. There’s something else that’s great if you are someone who likes to work with code. When you select code in either Dw or AC, since the line numbers are the same, the selection remains between the two products. It’s really great if you’re looking for something really specific in the code.
* **Upload local images to AC through Dreamweaver** - If you’re creating/editing an email within Dreamweaver you can simply select an image from your desktop or local machine. While Dreamweaver has always allowed you to do this, when Dreamweaver and Adobe Campaign are connected, the local file is immediately uploaded to the Adobe Campaign server. That means no need to manually upload images as content changes. Additionally, it ensures that the latest images are always live in Campaign.
* **Add Campaign personalization in Dreamweaver - **For the email developer there is no longer a need to add text like [[FIRSTNAME_PLACEHOLDER]] nor to look up the syntax of your data model’s scheme. The Campaign toolbar in Dreamweaver connects directly to your Campaign instance's data model. That means you can pull in any data you want for personalization from something like First Name to Address. If you’ve created Content Blocks within Campaign, you can also pull those directly into Dreamweaver.
