# External Signal Activity - Call a workflow with parameters{#external-signal-activity-call-a-workflow-with-parameters}

In ACS 19.2 the External Signal activity can not only call a workflow, but in addition pass parameters to the workflow (an audience name to target, a file name to import, a part of message content, etc.) to the workflow from another workflow or a REST API call to integrate with your external systems.

This also includes a new **test** activity where you can run tests on this functionality.

The video below shows how to use the external signal activity.
